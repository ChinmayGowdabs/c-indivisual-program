## Instructions

1. *Arithmetic Operations*
   - Accepts two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and exponential.

2. *Check Armstrong Number*
   - Validates whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

3. *Find Substrings*
   - Takes a user input string and prints all possible substrings.

4. *Divide by Zero Exception*
   - Demonstrates a try-catch block for handling a DivideByZeroException.

5. *Pascal's Triangle*
   - Generates and prints Pascal's Triangle based on the user-specified number of rows.

6. *Floyd's Triangle*
   - Generates and prints Floyd's Triangle based on the user-specified number of rows.

7. *Read File*
   - Reads and displays the content of a text file using different approaches, such as File.ReadAllText(), File.ReadAllLines(), and StreamReader.

8. *Stack Operations*
   - Implements a basic stack with operations like push, pop, peek, and display.

9. *Complex Number Operations*
   - Takes two complex numbers as input, performs addition, and displays the result.

10. *Shapes Drawing and Erasing*
    - Illustrates polymorphism by drawing and erasing various shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle).

11. *Shapes Area and Perimeter*
    - Calculates and displays the area and perimeter of different shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle).

12. *Resize Rectangle*
    - Allows the user to create a rectangle and then resize it by changing its width and height.
